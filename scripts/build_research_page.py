"""The filing-triage findings, as a page on the live site.

Every number is read from `evidence/real_run` at build time. None is written
into this file, and that is the whole design: a hand-written summary of a
measured result is a copy that drifts, and this project's argument is precisely
that numbers drift when nothing is watching. If the evidence is re-exported, this
page changes with it or fails loudly because a file it needs is missing.

The visual language is the Company Lens site's own -- warm paper, Georgia
headlines, the same blue -- because this is a section of that site rather than a
research paper bolted onto it.
