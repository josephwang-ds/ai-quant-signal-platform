"""The project explained to someone who does not work in finance or machine learning.

    python scripts/build_overview_page.py

The research page assumes a reader who knows what average precision is. Most
people who open this project do not, and the interesting part of it does not
require them to: the story is that a working system looked twice as good as it
was, that the reason was a single assumption about a timestamp, and that the
difference was measured and published rather than quietly fixed.

That story is legible to anyone. This page tells it in ordinary words, with the
numbers read from the same evidence package everything else reads, so it cannot
drift the way a hand-written summary does -- which is exactly what happened to
the write-up this page replaces.

**Jargon is not simplified here, it is absent.** No average precision, no ROC
AUC, no calibration, no bootstrap. Where a technical term is unavoidable it is
replaced by what it measures: "how often the top five contained something that
mattered" instead of "precision@5". The research page keeps the vocabulary for
readers who want it, and is linked from here.

<h1>A system that reads the day&rsquo;s filings &mdash; and a measurement of how
easy it is to fool yourself building one</h1>
<p class="lede">Every trading day, US public companies file legally-required
disclosures with the government. Most are routine. A few move the stock. An
analyst has time to read about five before the opening bell.</p>
</div></header>

<section class="band"><div class="wrap">
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>It ranks the morning&rsquo;s filings so the five someone reads are the five
worth reading. On {filings:,} real filings from {issuers or 193} companies:</p>
<div class="numbers">
<div><b>{_pct(m['daily_precision_at_5'])}</b><span>of the time, the top five
contained something that moved the stock</span></div>
<div><b>{_pct(m['daily_random_precision_at_5'])}</b><span>if you read five at
random</span><small>the honest comparison</small></div>
<div><b>{_pct(m['daily_oracle_precision_at_5'])}</b><span>if you somehow knew in
advance</span><small>most days do not contain five important filings</small></div>
</div>
<p style="margin-top:26px">So it captures about
<strong>{_pct(m['daily_span_captured_at_5'])} of everything there is to
capture</strong>. That ceiling is the honest way to read the first number: a
system cannot find what is not there.</p>
<div class="callout"><p>It predicts <strong>how big</strong> a reaction will be,
never which direction. There are no price targets, no buy or sell
recommendations, and no trading strategy anywhere in it. Predicting direction is
a bet against desks with faster data and more money; deciding what to read is a
problem worth solving.</p></div>
</div></section>

<section class="dark"><div class="wrap">
<h2>The part worth reading about</h2>
<p>The first working version scored far better than this. It was wrong, and not
in a way that announced itself.</p>
<p>In <strong>{impossible:,} cases</strong> it had bought a stock at a price
printed <em>before</em> the disclosure it was reacting to had been filed. Not a
bug in the model &mdash; a single assumption about what a timestamp meant. Three
other mistakes of the same family sat beside it. Every one of them flattered the
result, and none of them showed up as an error.</p>
<div class="swing">
<div class="bad"><b>{float(naive['average_precision']):.3f}</b>
<small>written the ordinary way</small></div>
<span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
<div class="good"><b>{float(honest['average_precision']):.3f}</b>
<small>after removing all four</small></div>
</div>
<p style="margin-top:30px">Removing them costs a third of the apparent
performance. <strong>Both numbers are published side by side</strong>, with the
tooling that found the problem and the tests that now fail the build if it comes
back. That is the argument of the whole project: a result you are pleased with
deserves more suspicion than one you are not, and the difference can be
measured.</p>
