"""The findings page, and why none of its numbers live in its source.

A hand-written summary of a measured result is a copy, and a copy drifts. This
project's whole argument is that numbers drift when nothing is watching, so the
page that makes that argument publicly cannot itself be a transcription: it is
generated from `evidence/real_run` at build time, and it fails loudly rather
than rendering a stale figure when the export is missing.
