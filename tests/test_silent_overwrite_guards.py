"""Three ways to get a wrong result with no error, and the guards that stop them.

Every leakage guard in this project raises rather than logs, because a check
that can be ignored is a comment. These three failures were the same shape and
had no guard at all: each produces a plausible artefact and reports success.

  demo over a real build   a synthetic corpus replaces tens of thousands of
                           real filings; the pipeline then runs perfectly on it
  a stale bundle           the packager copies HTML rather than rendering it,
                           so a deploy after a renderer change ships the old
                           pages and still succeeds
  a mismatched project ID  `vercel deploy` publishes to the environment's
                           project, ignoring the bundle's own link

Two of the three happened while this file was being written, which is the
argument for it.
