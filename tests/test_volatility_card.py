"""The volatility card, and the gate that decides whether it exists at all.

Plan §5.5 makes the card conditional: it ships only if the forecast intervals are
calibrated out of sample. That condition is enforced in one place -- the export
writes the card file for a forecaster that passed and deletes it otherwise -- so
these check that the single place works and that the page follows it.
